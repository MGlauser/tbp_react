          My earliest memory of anything is in my father's darkroom developing a roll of film. <br />
          While always looking for the beauty in life, photography became my passion early on and is now a way I bring balance to my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I bring many years of experience, an eye for beauty, lots of technical expertise, and a passion for photography into play with each and every photoshoot.<br />
          My low overhead means low prices to my clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Side by side with my loving wife on most of the shoots, photography has also become part of us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do all kinds of photography including portraits, families, helping
          models with their portfolios with TFCD (Trade For CD) and creating composite
          cards.  Types include artistic, scenics, products with a specialty of Art Glass, even pets. 
          I work indoor and outdoor.
